# Developer tools
Developer tools crucial for frontend software engineers. 
They help in;
- Debugging: Developer tools provide powerful debugging capabilities,<br> allowing frontend engineers to inspect and debug their code<br> easily. They can set breakpoints, inspect variables, <br>analyze network requests, and debug JavaScript in real-time.
- Performance Optimization: Performance is critical for web <br>applications. Developer tools offer various performance<br> profiling tools to analyze rendering performance, network <br>activity, and JavaScript execution time. Engineers can use <br>this information to identify bottlenecks and optimize their <br>code for better performance.
- Responsive Design: With the increasing variety of devices and <br>screen sizes, creating responsive designs is essential. <br>Developer tools provide device emulation and viewport resizing <br>features, allowing engineers to test and optimize their <br>designs for different screen sizes and resolutions.
- Accessibility Testing: Accessibility is an important aspect of <br>web development. Developer tools include accessibility <br>auditing features that help engineers identify accessibility <br>issues and ensure their websites are accessible to all users.
- Cross-browser Compatibility: Ensuring compatibility across <br>different browsers is a challenge for frontend developers.<br> Developer tools offer cross-browser testing capabilities, allowing <br>engineers to test their websites in multiple browsers and <br>troubleshoot compatibility issues.
- Code Inspection: Developer tools enable engineers to inspect <br>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. They can view the <br>DOM structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript events, making it easier to understand and debug complex codebases.
- Memory Management: Memory leaks and inefficient memory usage can <br>impact the performance of web applications. Developer tools <br>include memory profiling tools to analyze memory usage and <br>identify memory leaks, helping engineers optimize memory <br>management in their applications.

### General Requirements
> - A __README.md__ file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
> - Use the newest version of Google Chrome browser *(78.0.3904.70 or later)*.
> - Screenshots can be taken via the OS, not necessary via the DevTools. These <br>screenshots are usedto see how and where you are doing/playing with the DevTools.
